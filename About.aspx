       <p> My name is Khoa Nguyen. I'm currently a senior at University of North Texas (UNT). 
        I'm graduating in December 2017 in Business Computer Information System (BCIS) major. 
        I'm a person who found his true passion in designing and programming. 
        In this digital generation, I have been curious how the website and application work, I started teaching and learning myself how to code and design. 
        I learn almost things from Youtube and Google.
